### Setup Environment and Testing MVP Project
There are two ways to test the project. Please start with method A as it's the most simple way to start the demo. Adam and Henry, please try to test method B after you tried method A. Method B will open the entire project from Unity which allows you to look into all the details and codes.

#### Method A - Standalone

1. Download the most recent standalone app package: [PC version](https://github.com/nuvention-web/Team-H/tree/submission/UnityProjects/MVP_Slice/Executables/Windows) and [Mac version](https://github.com/nuvention-web/Team-H/tree/submission/UnityProjects/MVP_Slice/Executables/Mac). For PC version, please make sure you have download **both the *.exe file and the data folder**.
2. Once you have downloaded the file, simple launch it and you should be able to play.

#### Method B - Unity Editor

1. Download the most recent Unity project package [here](https://github.com/nuvention-web/Team-H/blob/submission/UnityProjects/MVP_Slice/UnityProject/ShareVR_v1_2.zip).
2. Once you downloaded it. Unzip the file, launch Unity Editor and open the project folder you have just unzipped. It will probably take some time to open the project.
3. Once it's finished, you should have the *MVP_Capture* scene loaded.
