### Setup Environment and Testing MVP Project
There are two ways to test the project. You can start with method A and then check more details in method B.

### Method A - Launch Executable Directly

1. I have compiled an executable of the project using Unity. Please follow [this link]() to download the file.
2. Once you have downloaded the file, simple launch it and you should be able to play.

### Method B - Open the Project in Unity Editor

1. The entire project is uploaded [here](). Try download the entire project.
2. Once you downloaded it. Open Unity Engine and open the project by finding the project you have just downloaded. It will probably take some time to open the project.
3. Once it's finished, you should have the *MVP_Slice* scene loaded.
